Demographic indicators such as age, gender, marital status, financial literacy, education and profession along with household characteristics such as household income state and region of residence will be used to predict the credit card behavior. These variables play might play crucial role in determining the credit card behavior of any individual."

Global financial crisis of 2007-2008 is greatly considered as a result of subprime mortgage loans in the United States. In addition, a huge amount of credit card payments goes pending every month in the US. While credit card debt has increase around 32% in the last five years. Therefore, to avoid future banking crisis, it is important to devise a mechanism that can predict the credit card behavior of the potential user."

This dataset is a primary data collected from the US citizens with an interval of three years. The first round of survey was conducted in the year of 2009 following the Global financial turmoil. Later on, second round was conducted in 2012, third in 2015 and most recent survey was conducted in 2018. More detail of the dataset can be found [here](https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/) and can be downloaded [here](https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/downloads.php). This dataset includes a wide range of financial, demographic and professional indicators of American Citizens from all the regions and states. Since dataset includes regional information, I will use Foursquare API to access Foursquare location data for US to compare the US states based on credit card behavior. I will combine the NFCS dataset with the US location data in order to explore the areas and states with good credit records and bad credit records. This result of this analysis might be useful for banks and other financial institutions as well as for Government to devise credit policy in the different regions based on the credit card behavior of the population.\n"
